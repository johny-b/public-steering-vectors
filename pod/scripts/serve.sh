# CUDA graphs are left on. The steering is inside the target block's forward
# (see patch.py), so capture records it like any other arithmetic in the model.
# Measured on Qwen3.6-27B on one H200, that is worth about 3x the output rate of
# a single request against the same server started eager.
#
# VLLM_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE is set above because vLLM's cache key does not
# include this plugin: without it a steered engine can replay an artefact
# compiled without the steering, which is unsteered generation reporting
# success.

# --middleware is what turns a request naming a vector this server does not
# have into a 400. Without it such a request is served by the unsteered model,
# and the only sign of it is a line in the worker's log.
